# Database-Querier

This was the final project for the ECE 150 course in Waterloo. It uses pointers, linked-lists, constructors, destructors, and object-oriented programming to work with large datasets. The final result is a highly-efficient program written in C++.

I worked on the following files in this project: History_Transaction_definitions.cpp and transaction_history.txt
